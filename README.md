☕ Java Development Internship – CodSoft

I’m pleased to share that I successfully completed my Java Development Internship at CodSoft, where I had the opportunity to work on practical projects focused on Core Java and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
This experience helped me move beyond theory and apply concepts in real coding scenarios, improving both my problem-solving approach and coding confidence.

🚀 Projects Completed
🎯 Number Guessing Game

A console-based interactive game where users guess a randomly generated number within limited attempts.
Key learnings: random number generation, user input handling, conditional logic, loops.

📊 Grade Calculator

A program that calculates total marks, percentage, and grade based on multiple subject inputs.
Key learnings: input validation, data processing, decision-making logic.

🏧 ATM Machine Simulation

A menu-driven banking simulation allowing balance checks, deposits, and withdrawals.
Key learnings: OOP implementation, encapsulation, real-world problem modeling.

🎓 Student Management System

A console application to add, remove, search, and display student records using ArrayList.
Key learnings: object management, CRUD operations, collections framework.

💡 Skills Strengthened

Core Java programming fundamentals

Object-Oriented Programming (Encapsulation, Class Design)

Logical thinking and control flow implementation

Data handling using ArrayList

Input validation and menu-driven application design

🙌 Acknowledgment

I’m grateful to CodSoft for providing this opportunity to gain hands-on experience, improve my coding skills, and deepen my understanding of Java development through practical work.
